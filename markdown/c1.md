## <a id="c1"></a>Chapter 1: Where we are introduced to first-class function, gather vital supplies and implement map()

In Javascript, functions are first-class citizens. First-class functions are treated as 
any other value, which means that they can be: 

- Passed to or returned from other functions,
- Assigned to variables;
- Stored in data structures.

If the first point seems abstract to you, think about all the times you have used 
callbacks for an Ajax call: that's it, you passed a function to a function!

Let's see what else these features allow us to do.

### <a id="c1_functions_as_arguments"></a>Functions as arguments

Passing a function as an argument to other functions can help us write more general, 
reusable code - and, possibly, survive the undead.

For instance, here is an array of objects representing the known supply points:

```javascript
var supplyPoints = [
    {
        distance: 11.2,
        supplies: ['food', 'medicines']
    },
    {
        distance: 3.5,
        supplies: ['weapons', 'medicines']
    },
    {
        distance: 7,
        supplies: ['food', 'weapons']
    }
];
```

Each object contains the distance in kilometers from our home base to the supply point it represents and the supplies that we can find there.

### <a id="c1_the_imperative_approach"></a>The imperative approach

You'd like to know how long it will take for you to reach each of the supply points, so you 
come up with the function `getTimes`. Assuming you'll jog at a speed of 10 km/h:

```javascript
/**
    Returns the time necessary to reach each supply point.
    @param {Array} supplyPoints - Objects representing supply points.
    @returns {Array} times (in hours) necessary to reach each supply point.
*/
function getTimes(supplyPoints) {
    // Initialize an empty array to store our times
    var times = [];
    var speed = 10;
    for (var i = 0; i < supplyPoints.length; i++) {
        // Divide the distance from each supply point by the speed,
        // and push the result to `times`.
        times.push(supplyPoints[i].distance / speed);
    }
    return times;
}
```

Cool, you made it! Now it's sufficient to call, for instance, `getTimes(supplyPoints)` 
to know that, at 10 Km/h, you will need `[1.12, 0.35, 0.7]` hours to reach the first, 
second and third supply points.

As you can see, though, not all the supply points provide for the same necessities. Let's
write a function to check the availability of food in each supply point.

```javascript
/**
    Returns the availability of food in each supply point.
    @param {Array} supplyPoints - Objects representing supply points.
    @returns {Array} Truth values for the presence of the product in each supply point.
*/
function checkEachForFood(supplyPoints, product) {
    // Initialize an empty array to store our product availabilities
    var productAvailabilities = [];
    for (var i = 0; i < supplyPoints.length; i++) {
        // Array#indexOf returns the index if the array contains a specified
        // element; otherwise, it returns -1
        // We will use it to check if `"food"` is included in the
        // `supplies` property of each supply point.
        var index = supplyPoints[i].supplies.indexOf(food);
        // Let's push true if there is such product, false otherwise
        if (index != -1) {
            productAvailabilities.push(true);
        } else {
            productAvailabilities.push(false);
        }
    }
    return productAvailabilities;
}
```

Now we can check for food supplies: `checkEachForFood(supplyPoints)` returns
`[true, false, true]`, telling us that we can find food in the first and third
supply point.

### <a id="c1_the_functional_approach"></a>The functional approach
You might have noticed how `checkEachForFood` and `getTimes` do something very 
similar: they loop through the elements of an array, do something to each element, and return an array
of the results. How can we make the process less repetitive? By passing functions as arguments!

Having first-class functions allows us to build a generic function which:

- Takes an array and a function (`callback`);
- Applies the callback to each element of the array;
- Returns an array of result.

Let's first write simple iterator functions for our two problems: they will be
passed one `supplyPoint` object at a time and return, respectively:

- The time needed to reach said supply point given a speed of 10 km/h and
- A true/false value indicating the presence of food in said supply point.

Here they are:

```javascript
/**
    Given a supplyPoint object, return the time needed to reach it
    @param {Object} supplyPoint - A supplyPoint object
    @returns {Number} Time needed to reach the supplyPoint in hours
*/
function getTime(supplyPoint) {
  return supplyPoint.distance / 10
}

/**
    Checks if a supplypoint has food
    @param {Object} supplyPoint - A supplyPoint object
    @returns {Boolean}
*/
function checkForFood(supplyPoint) {
    // The construct with "?" and ":" called "ternary operator".
    // You probably saw it before, but if what it does is not 
    // completely clear, go look it up! It's very useful.
    return (supplyPoint.supplies.indexOf("food") != -1) ? true : false
}
```

Now that we have our iterator functions, we can write the generic function which 
will allow us to apply it to each element of our supplyPoints array.

```javascript
/**
    Applies a function to each element of an array.
    @param {Array} list - The array to loop through
    @param {Function} callback - The function to apply to each elements
    @returns {Array}
*/ 
function applyToEach(list, callback) {
    // This array will contain the results
    var results = [];
    for (var i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
        // Apply our callback function to the element
        var result = callback(list[i]);
        // Push it to our results array
        results.push(result);
    }
    return results;
}
```

Let's try it out:

    applyToEach(supplyPoints, getTime);
    result: [1.12, 0.35, 0.7]

    applyToEach(supplyPoints, checkForFood);
    result: [true, false, true]

Great, isn't it? And this `applyToEach` function is so flexible; there's so
much more it can do!

### <a id="c1_other_uses"></a>Other uses of applyToEach

For instance, let's say we're planning to transport our supplies in cubical crates
of different dimentions. Here is an array of their sides' lengths, in cm:

    var crates = [40, 75, 32, 100]

We know every can of food is 140cm³, and we'd like to know how many items each crate
could hold.

Here is a function that, given a single crate's side, tells us how many cans it can
store (assuming they always fit perfectly):

```javascript
/**
    Returns the numer of cans that can fit in a crate
    @param {Number} crateSide - The crate's side in cm
    @returns {Number} The number of cans which will fit
*/
function cansInCrate(crateSide) {
    var canVolume = 140;
    var crateVolume = crateSide * crateSide * crateSide;
    // Math.floor rounds the result to the bottom - so, 10.5 cans
    // will just be 10 - it's not like we could cut them in half!
    return Math.floor(crateVolume / canVolume);
}
```

Wanna apply it to each element of our `crates` array, to see how many cans each can bear?

Easy!

    applyToEach(crates, cansInCrate);
    result: [457, 3013, 234, 7142]

Ta-dah! See how easy magic becomes when you can feed functions to other functions?

This particular use for first-class function (apply an iterator over each element
of an array) is incredibly powerful, and almost any existing javascript library has 
its own implementation.

You probably recognized it already: it is the famous **map** function, present
in jQuery as `$.map()`, in underscore.js as `_.map()` etc.

**Map** is so popular and useful that it's been added to the standard array methods -
meaning that, in a modern browser, writing

    crates.map(cansInCrate)

Is the same as writing

    applyToEach(crates, cansInCrates)

Try it out!

### <a id="c1_glossary"></a>Glossary
#### First-class functions
A language that supports *First-class functions* treats functions like any other value. 
Javascript supports first-class functions: you can pass them to other functions, assign 
them to variables and include them in data structures.

#### Higher-order functions
A mathematical concept describing functions which operate on other functions, accepting 
functions as arguments and/or returning them as values. Its implementation in computer 
programs is possible thanks to the presence of *First-class functions*.

`applyToEach`, a.k.a. `map`, is a *Higher-order function*.

#### Callback
In this context, a function which is passed as an argument to another function.

The concept of *Callbacks* is not unique to functional programming. Languages
lacking *Fist-class functions* could still use callbacks through other methods
(if you are familiar with c or c++, you are probably used to pass function pointers
to some external library functions).
