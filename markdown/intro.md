## Intro

Our examples will all assume the following scenario.

The crisis started one week ago; cellular networks are now off-line but the last time 
you managed to access the internet the news bulletins were announcing a nationwide epidemic.

You are hiding in a storage space together with four other survivors. There's running 
water from a utility faucet on the wall, but the food reserves are running low.

There are supply points, which may or may not have been invaded by zombies, but they're 
all pretty far away. 

Zombies are mostly lazy by day, but definitely deadly by night.

There is a scientist with us. He might find a cure for the zombie virus, given enough 
time and the necessary instrumentation.

## Conventions

This guide respects [Douglas Crockford's conventions on javascript syntax](http://javascript.crockford.com/code.html), since most other manuals follow
them and we'd rather keep our personal and quite controversial opinions on
javascript style at bay in a text aimed to beginners.

Every function is documented with [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/)-style 
declaration.

The result of function evaluations is represented as follows:

    Math.floor(1.3);
    result: 1

## Reading the guide

Many concepts will be introduced in each chapter; at the end of the chapter they will be summarized in a small **glossary** section.

It is very important to read the chapters in order. If there is still 
something you don't understand at the end of a chapter, feel free to open an
issue on the github repository and I will try to include further explanations
in the following versions of the guide.

You are encouraged to type in all the code in the javascript console as we go, 
to see the results immediately. To open the javascript console in Chrome, 
use `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `i` to open the developer tools panel, and press `esc`
to toggle the console.
