## <a id="intro"></a>Intro: Zombies

Our examples will all assume the following scenario.

The crisis started one week ago; cellular networks are now off-line but the last time 
you managed to access the internet the news bulletins were announcing a nationwide epidemic.

You are hiding in a storage space together with four other survivors. There's running 
water from a utility faucet on the wall, but the food reserves are running low.

There are supply points, which may or may not have been invaded by zombies, but they're 
all pretty far away. 

Zombies are mostly lazy by day, but definitely deadly by night.

There is a scientist with us. He might find a cure for the zombie virus, given enough 
time and the necessary instrumentation.
