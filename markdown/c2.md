## Chapter 2
### Where we chose the best supply points, learn about lambda functions, implement filter() and a functional max().

**Lambda functions** (or **anonymous functions**, or simply lambdas for close acquaintances) constitute another very 
useful feature of Functional Programming.

They provide a handy way to pass callbacks for higher-order functions on the fly. Here's 
how, instead of first declaring a function and then passing it by name, we pass a lambda 
as an argument to  `applyToEach`:

```javascript
applyToEach(supplyPoints, function(element) {
    // Each supply point will be passed to this anonymous function;
    // let's return true if the supply point is less than 5km away. 
    return element.distance < 5:
});
```

You can also assign an anonymous function to a variable:

```javascript
var square = function(x) {
    return x * x;
}
```

It is now possible to invoke the function through is name: `square(4)`, as if it were
declared with `function square() {...}`.

There are several other uses for lambas, and we will take a look at many of them as we proceed.


### Filtering

In two of the situations we encountered until now (checking which supply point have food
and which ones are close enough) we received an array of booleans.

Wouldn't it be easier to just know which supply points satisfy our conditions - for
instance, couldn't a function simply return the index numbers of those who do?

Let's see how:

```javascript 
/**
    Returns an array containing the indices of the elements of the original
    array for which the callback returns true
    @param {Array} list - The array to loop through
    @param {Function} callback - The function to apply to each elements
    @returns {Array}
*/
function filter(list, callback) {
    // This array will contain the indices of the "good" elements
    var goodIndices = [];
    for (var i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
        // If the callback applied to a given element returns true
        if (callback(list[i])) {
            // ... we push its index into our result array.
            goodIndices.push(i);
        }
    }
    return goodIndices;
}
```

Enough refactoring: the dusk is coming; we only have one and a half hours of sunlight 
left before the undead will start rampaging the street - to make the matters worse, 
we are in dire need of supplies. Which supply points could we hit, coming back safely 
to the home base before sundown?

Let's use a lambda function as callback for our newly created `filter` to find the
answer.

```javascript 
filter(supplyPoints, function(supplyPoint) {
    // Our speed is still of 10 km/h...
    var speed = 10;
    // ... and we have an hour and a half left
    var timeLeft = 1.5
    // How much time would it take to reach this supply point?
    var timeNeeded = supplyPoint.distance / speed;
    // Return true if it's enough and false if it is not
    return timeNeeded < timeLeft;
});
```

And the result is `[1, 2]` which means (since javascript arrays' indices start at 0)
that we can safely hit the second and third supply point!

The function we just created, `filter`, is also included in many libraries - and, in
modern browsers, is a method of `Array`, so we could simply use

```javascript
supplyPoints.filter(function(supplyPoint) {
    var speed = 10;
    var timeLeft = 1.5
    var timeNeeded = supplyPoint.distance / speed;
    return timeNeeded < timeLeft;
});
```

### Finding the best candidate

You managed to bring back the supplies on time, everybody cheers but you're kind of 
frustrated: none of them has spoken or acted since the start of your adventure (but 
that's what you get when you read programming manuals instead of fiction, so you might 
just let it go), and it looks like it's always your responsibility to go and fetch
supplies.

You ask your comrades to introduce themselves, at least, and they eagerly reply providing
you with the following array of objects.

```javascript 
var comrades = [
    {
        name: "Alix",
        gender: "F",
        occupation: "Scientist",
        age: 27,
        speed: 8.5,
        health: 10
    },
    {
        name: "Luigi",
        gender: "M",
        occupation: "Plumber",
        age: 41,
        speed: 6,
        health: 6
    },
    {
        name: "Carl",
        gender: "M",
        occupation: "Young Nobleman",
        age: 35,
        speed: 12,
        health: 6
    }
];
```

You go to sleep, wondering why were you so convinced that the scientist would have been
a man, and wake up to find out that the faucet is now dry.

There is a river, but it's 7 km away - and it's about time some of the others started
contributing to the common welfare.

Considering that, due to the deadly miasmas pervading the streets, every hour
outside would drain three units of health, you'll have to chose which comrade would come
back with the most health.

You start with creating a function which, for a given candidate, returns the health he
would preserve once back from his or her errand - we'll assign it to the varìiable
`getRemainingHealth`.

```javascript 
var getRemainingHealth = function(comrade) {
    // Calculate the time it would take for the comrade reach the river 
    // and come back to safety.
    var totalTime = 7 * 2 / comrade.speed;
    // How much health would the comrade would lose in that time?
    var lostHealth = totalTime * 3;
    return comrade.health - lostHealth;
};
```

We'd like to know which candidate will have the most health in the end. A solution would
be looping through the candidates, keeping track of the maximum result of 
`getRemainingHealth` and switching it with the new result if it is greater:

```javascript
/**
    Get the best candidate to send out to fetch water.
    @param {Array} comrades - An array of comrade objects
    @returns {Object} The best candidate
*/
var getBestCandidate = function(comrades) {
    // We start by setting the bestHealth variable to the lowest
    // possible value. Infinity is a javascript global variable 
    // which will always be higher than any value it's compared to.
    // Conversely, -Infinity will always be lower.
    var bestHealth = -Infinity;
    var bestCandidate = null;
    for (var i = 0; i < comrades.length; i++) {
         // To make our code clearer, let's assign each comrade we are
         // testing to the "candidate" variable.
         var candidate = comrades[i];
         // We check whether the candidate under scrutiny
         // fares better than the previous best. (The first candidate
         // surely will, since anything is greater that -Infinity!)
         if (remainingHealth(candidate) > bestHealth) {
             // If it does, we have the new best!
             bestHealth = remainingHealth(candidate);
             bestCandidate = candidate;
        }
    }
    return bestCandidate;
};
```

### A functional max()

What if we had a more generic function which, given an array and a callback, returned
the element that, passed to the callback, returned the maximum result? Something tells
you that, just like `map`/`applyToEach`, such a function might come in handy in more
than this occasion.

Besides, it looks like it's incredibly easy to absteact it from our `getBestCandidate` 
function!

```javascript
/**
    Returns the array element that, when passed to the callback,
    returns the highest result.
    @param {Array} list
    @param {Function} callback
    @returns an element from list.
*/
var functionalMax = function(list, callback) {
     var maxValue = -Infinity;
     var maxElement = null;
     for (var i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
         var candidate = list[i];
         if (callback(candidate) > maxValue) {
              maxValue = callback(candidate);
              maxElement = candidate;
         }
     }
     return maxElement;
}
```

Let's test it with a simple anonymous callback function to find out which comrade is 
healthier!

```
functionalMax(comrades, function(comrade) {
    return comrade.health;
})
```

Wow, that was fast! And which one is faster?

```
functionalMax(comrades, function(comrade) {
    return comrade.health;
})
```

That's it! The result of the callback (which, in this case, is simply the speed or the 
age of each comrade) will be compared, and you'll get back an that comrade's object - in 
our last try:

```javascript 
{
    name: "Alix",
    gender: "F",
    occupation: "Scientist",
    age: 27,
    speed: 8.5,
    health: 10
}
```

### Glossary

#### Lambda function

A function built without being directly assigned a name.

They come from [lambda calculus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus), a formal
system invented before computers existed, in which all functions are anonymous.

They're incredibly useful to use with higher-order functions!

#### Filter

A higher-order function which applies a callback to all elements of a list, and return
those elements for which the callback returns true.
