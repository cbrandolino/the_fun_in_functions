## Audience and scope
This guide is aimed at programmers with some basic experience of Javascript who:

- Want to make a more extensive and more conscious use of its functional capabilities;
- Are curious about all the fuss around FP;
- Like magic.

Each chapter will introduce one of the many concepts of FP, combining it with the 
previous ideas to tackle real-life, zombie-related problems in a functional fashion.

Being a beginner's guide, some non-functional javascript features are also explained
*en passant*, in order to clarify the examples.
